            <p>
                Hurricane Florence is estimated to cost over $17 billion, and it isn’t the only extreme storm that hit the Southeastern United States in recent years. Hurricane Harvey, which was the second most costly hurricane in US history, cost over $125 billion, second only to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many climate advocates say these storms are being worsened by global climate change. Climate change is usually measured by the yearly sea surface temperature anomaly. This measures how different any given year’s average temperature was from a baseline measure. The graph below shows the annual temperature anomaly for 1880 to 2015 compared to the average yearly temperature from 1971-2000.
            </p>

            <div id="tempChart"></div>

            <p>
                But what about the storms? According the National Ocean and Atmospheric Association, it is unclear whether global warming will lead to more hurricanes. However, even a one degree increase in the temperature of the Atlantic ocean is predicted to increase the intensity of tropical storms as well the likelihood that a storm reaches a Category 4 or 5.
            </p>
               <p>
                   Why is this? According to NASA, warm, wet air fuels hurricanes. This is why they often form near the equator in the Atlantic Ocean. As the warm air creates a larger and larger storm, the earth’s spin starts to influence the way the clouds move, which then creates their cyclone shape. Long story short, more warm water means more warm, wet air, which means more fuel for hurricanes.
               </p>
               <p>
                   Since the global temperature has already increased, are the storms of the past few years part of this coming phenomenon? Let’s look at North Carolina.
               </p>
               <p>
                   This scatter plot shows how many storms impacted North Carolina each year since 1851. The size of each bubble is based on the average maximum wind speed recorded in each storm that year, a measure of intensity.
               </p>

            <div id="stormsChart"></div>

            <p>
                It’s unclear if the storms are getting stronger. It’s also unclear if the yearly number has increased.
            </p>


              <p>
                  Below is a line based on the above scatterplot showing the number of storms per year. It’s increasing but so slightly that it’s not even statistically significant.

            <p>
                So, at least in North Carolina, we haven’t started to see the predicted results of climate change on hurricanes.</p>
